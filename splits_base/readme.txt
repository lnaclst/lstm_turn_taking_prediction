Lists of data splits are stored here to aid reproducibility.
To run the code, you need to create a folder in your local repo called splits/ at the same level as splits_base. 
Move the training, test and complete lists for your chosen dataset to the new splits/ folder, and rename them:
complete.txt
training.tx
testing.txt
